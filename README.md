# Number Guessing Game

## A nunber-guessing game created in Java 
This project generates a random number and asks the user to guess that number.

The user can initially set the difficulty level from 1 to 5 where 1 is the easiest and 5 being the most difficult.
Increase in difficulty means that the range of the random number increases.

The user is then asked how many tries they would like to have.

If the user's guessed number is bigger than the random number generated, the user is prompted with "The number is smaller".
If the guessed number is smaller than the random number, the prompt will say "The number is bigger".
If the user guesses the number correctly, the game finished and the user is prompted with:
"You have guessed correctly!", and the answer.

I am new to GitHub and this is my first project to be uploaded here, so please don't hesitate to advice me on any improvements I could make!
